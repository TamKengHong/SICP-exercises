# SICP-exercises
I am a first time programmer who was looking for a good book about computer science and programming and found SICP.
I am on a mission to complete all (almost all) the exercises.

# Study Plan
I first watch the MIT SICP lectures before starting on reading the relevant parts of the book. Then I do the exercises.
I try to provide comments on how I came about to the solutions so that I can re-solve the exercises in the future + other programmers may benefit from my comments and solutions.

# Progress
Chapter 1 done!
Chapter 2 done! 
Chapter 3 done!
Started on Chapter 4.

# To-do
Make a sicp lecture guide to show which parts of the lecture correspond to which parts of the book.
