#lang sicp

;first we just copy the style of the code.
;then we do a cons (car s) first to make the procedure correctly avg each
;value of sense data with the previous one. without the start, it would be
;avging the future values.

(define (smooth s)
  (let ((avpt (/ (+ (stream-car s)
                    (stream-car (stream-cdr s)))
                 2)))
    (cons-stream
     (stream-car s)
     (cons-stream
      avpt
      (smooth (stream-cdr s))))))
