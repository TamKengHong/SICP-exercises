#lang sicp

;this produces a stream of integers that are the representation of
;num/denom in base radix.

;basically, u can tell by the head of stream is always the quotient,
;and the tail of the stream is the remainder. then u expand it again and
;again.

;eg, (expand 1 7 10) = decimal expansion of 1/7.
;likewise, (expand 3 8 10) = (0 3 7 5)
