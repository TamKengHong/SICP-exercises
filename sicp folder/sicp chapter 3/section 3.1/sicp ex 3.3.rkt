;ok so for this, we need to use cond to check if secret password is applied,
;then continue as usual if it is.
;lets just change the conds in dispatch cuz it seems logical and nice.

(define (make-account balance password)
  (define (withdraw amount)
    (if (>= balance amount)
        (begin (set! balance (- balance amount))
               balance)
        "Insufficient funds"))
  (define (deposit amount)
    (set! balance (+ balance amount))
    balance)
  (define (dispatch p m)
    (cond ((not (eq? p password)) (error "Incorrect password"))
          ((eq? m 'withdraw) withdraw)
          ((eq? m 'deposit) deposit)
          (else (error "Unknown request: MAKE-ACCOUNT"
                       m))))
  dispatch)
;ok nice this works perfectly.
