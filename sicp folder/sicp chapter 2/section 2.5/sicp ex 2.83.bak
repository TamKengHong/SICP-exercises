;so we want a procedure that raises to the next level of the tower for each
;type. Thus, lets write all the diff procedures out.

;so, an integer is a rational with denom 1, to make real from rat, we just
;divide the numer and denom together, and to make complex number from real
;we just add 0 to its imaginary part.
;make sure to attach back a new tag aft we stripped it!

(define (raise-int-to-rat int)
  (attach-tag 'rational (make-rat (contents int) 1)))
(define (raise-rat-to-real rat)
  (attach-tag 'real (/ (numer rat) (denom rat))))
(define (raise-real-to-complex real)
  (attach-tag 'complex (make-complex-from-real-imag (contents real) 0)))

;now time to put into the table so we can do apply-generic raise.
(define (raise x) (apply-generic 'raise x))

(put 'raise 'integer raise-int-to-rat)
(put 'raise 'rational raise-rat-to-real)
(put 'raise 'real raise-real-to-complex)
