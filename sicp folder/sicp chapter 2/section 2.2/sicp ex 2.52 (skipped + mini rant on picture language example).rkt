;skipped
;time for a mini rant. i feel that this picture language example thing
;is pretty meaningless and tedious and unfun. while the thought process
;shown is quite good (abstraction, language design, etc primitives etc)
;i feel that the exercises and examples were quite boring and unmotivated.
;it was a drag to do, and also scheme does not rly support picture language
;so i could not really test out myself on what everything does, i just
;have to kind of accept the fact that things work out. It teaches quite
;little and is a boring unfun unmotivated recap of everything else, i did
;not feel like i learnt anything from the exercises and examples.
