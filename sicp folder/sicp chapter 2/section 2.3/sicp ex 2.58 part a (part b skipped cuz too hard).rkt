;one idea i have is to parse the list given and change it into prefix
;notation, then do what deriv usually does.
;they say we need to change the predicates, selectors and constructors
;in the qn tho..., by doing the above we wont change shit.

;ok first try: we know the operand is in the middle, then addend and augend
;are beside it. so lets change those up and see how it goes.

;ok done this was easy. all we did was change the representation and thats
;it.

;part b is way too hard as it builds on ex 2.57, so its even harder D:
;so lets skip.
