#lang sicp
;theres 3 strategies being talked about here, 1. generic operations with
;explicit dispatch, 2. data-directed programming, 3. message-passing
;to add new types or operations,
;for 1., to add a new type, just attach a tag to it, to add an operation,
;have to add the whole thing for all representations i think
;for 2., do a put on the table of types/operations
;for 3., message-passing allows us to dispatch new operations v easily,
;but for new types, have to do the whole thing for all diff types.
