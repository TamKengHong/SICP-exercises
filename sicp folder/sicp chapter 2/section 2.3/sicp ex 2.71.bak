;the tree will look like this. one main branch going down and then for every
;branch it splits, like /\
;                        /\
;                         /\ ...
;this is because the sum of the previous 2 least valued symbols will always
;be less than the 3rd one. eg. 1+2 = 3 less than 4, 3+4 less than 8
;and so on. thus, the most frequent symbol is always at the top so 1 bit
;is used to encode it, while the least frequent is at the bottom where
;n bits are used to encode it.
